NiMob

A better way of making changes

NiMob is a browser and device friendly interface to the Infoblox Grid.
The days of the cli are over and it's time we moved into using interfaces
that are better suited to the devices we have at hand.

The main objective is to make it as fast, and as simple as possible
to make a change to an object in the grid.

You may be able to get 
[more details from the website](http://www.slc.com.au/home/nimob) 
Or you can just take a chance,
[download the build](https://github.com/slchorne/nimob/blob/master/nimob-0.1.b.tgz?raw=true)
, and follow the 
[install guide](INSTALL.md) here


WARNING
-------

*THIS PRODUCT IS IN NO WAY SUPPORTED BY INFOBLOX !*

Don't go to them asking for help, don't go to them insisting on support
beause you installed this and now require it for production. They can't,
won't, and shouldn't help you. This is my gift to you, and that's all

This is the first BETA release and probably has lots of bugs.

*PLEASE [submit bug reports](https://github.com/slchorne/nimob/issues)!*

Use the damn thing, but let me know what works and what doesn't

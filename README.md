A better way of making changes

NiMob is a browser and device friendly interface to the Infoblox Grid.
The days of the cli are over and it's time we moved into using interfaces
that are better suited to the devices we have at hand.

You may be able to get [more details from the
website](http://www.slc.com.au/home/nimob) Or you can just take a chance,

[download the build](https://github.com/slchorne/nimob/blob/master/nimob-0.1.b.tgz?raw=true)
, and follow the 
[INSTALL.md](install guide) here


WARNING
-------

This is the first BETA release and probably has lots of bugs.

But, the main objective is to make it as fast and as simple as possible
to make a change to an object in the grid.

PLEASE submit bug reports!

Use the damn thing, but let me know what works and what doesn't

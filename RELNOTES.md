RELEASE NOTES
=============

Version 0.1.b
-------------

If you mess up the login credentials you can't connect until your account
times out. Logins are CASE SENSITIVE, make sure you lowercase the first
letter of your userID

Typeface is too dim when you view the details of an object using a safari
webapp (it's a css bug)

Doesn't work well with self signed certs
    You must accept the ssl cert via a normal web page
    or you get 'internal server' type errors
    * this also happens with proxies *
    * this also happens with file:// urls *

If you get a communication error to the grid, you will
have to reset the account to reload the data
 - just edit the account, then press 'done'

If you add, and then immediately delete an object it
    will sometimes re-appear in the lists

If you delete a host from the IPAM search, the search
results aren't updated to reflect the delete
    manually re-do the search to freresh the data

Approvals doesn't handle requests for more then one object
